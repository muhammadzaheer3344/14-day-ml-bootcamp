## 🔄 How It Works

### Workflow Process

1. **Data Input** 
   - User enters customer information (demographics, services, billing)

2. **Feature Processing** 
   - Automated data validation
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables

3. **Model Inference** 
   - Ensemble model generates prediction
   - Calculates churn probability

4. **Results Visualization** 
   - Displays confidence score
   - Shows key risk factors
   - Provides actionable recommendations

### Prediction Logic

The model analyzes historical patterns to identify behavioral indicators of churn:
- **Service Cancellations**: Customers canceling services are at higher risk
- **Payment Issues**: Late payments correlate with increased churn
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month customers are more likely to churn
- **Tenure**: Newer customers have higher churn risk
- **Engagement**: Lower service usage indicates potential churn

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Port 8501 already in use
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port=8502
```

**Issue**: Missing dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

**Issue**: Model file not found
- Ensure all `.pkl` files are in the `models/` directory
- Re-run model training if files are missing
